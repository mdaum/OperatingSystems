I had not used any of my 72 late hours on previous assignments, and saved them all for this assignment in aims of putting as much time as I could on fine-grained locking since I found this assignment to be the most interesting (and useful in the future!).
Will be submitting this assignment before the 72 hour mark which is Wednesday at 11:59 PM.
